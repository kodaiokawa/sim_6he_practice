# sim_6he_practice
simulation practice of 6he experiment as my first project

## Usage
if you edit the CMakeLists.txt, prease command in /build directory
```console
cmake ..
```
and you edit some file, type
``` console
make
```
after that, I think the /build/a.out file is created, so the program can be done by
```console
./a.out
```
